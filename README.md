# Ex-1: Introduction to GitHub Submission Process

## Overview

In this assignment, I'm going to familiarize myself with the GitHub submission process. 
## Objectives

- I will become comfortable with the GitHub submission process by completing a function that outputs my name.
- I aim to push my changes and successfully run the autograder to validate my submission.

## The Assignment

The file `get_a_point_for_writing_your_name.py` contains methods that are incomplete. These are causing the tests to fail. My task is to:
- Modify these methods to output the correct results.
- Ensure that the tests pass, which is essential for my submission to be successful.

## Validating and Evaluating My Results

### Online

1. **Commit and Push**: After I make my changes, I'll commit and push the code. I'll check the mark near the commit ID on GitHub to see if it was successful.
2. **Identify Test Failures**: If some tests fail, a ❌ will appear. I'll click on it to see detailed error information.
3. **Error Analysis**: I'll click on the [Details]() link to understand the errors better. I need to pay attention to lines that contain "Failed" or "error".
4. **Check My Score**: My score will be displayed at the bottom of the [Details]() page. I’m aiming for a 5/5 score.
5. **Success Indicator**: A green checkmark near my commit ID will indicate that I've achieved a perfect score.

### Locally

1. **Install pytest**: I will install pytest using `pip install pytest` or `conda install pytest`.
2. **Run Local Tests**: In the terminal, within my project directory, I'll run the command `pytest`. This will show me the status of each test and any errors that occurred.
